    "Here's a simple workflow with some basic univariate statistics and distribution representativity. This should help you get started data declustering to address spatial sampling bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geostatistical Sampling Representativity\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we should assume that all spatial data that we work with is biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Source of Spatial Sampling Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is collected to answer questions:\n",
    "* how far does the contaminant plume extend? – sample peripheries\n",
    "* where is the fault? – drill based on seismic interpretation\n",
    "* what is the highest mineral grade? – sample the best part\n",
    "* who far does the reservoir extend? – offset drilling\n",
    "and to maximize NPV directly:\n",
    "* maximize production rates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Sampling**: when every item in the population has a equal chance of being chosen. Selection of every item is independent of every other selection.\n",
    "Is random sampling sufficient for subsurface?  Is it available?\n",
    "* it is not usually available, would not be economic\n",
    "* data is collected answer questions\n",
    "    * how large is the reservoir, what is the thickest part of the reservoir \n",
    "* and wells are located to maximize future production\n",
    "    * dual purpose appraisal and injection / production wells!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular Sampling**: when samples are taken at regular intervals (equally spaced).  \n",
    "* less reliable than random sampling.\n",
    "* Warning: may resonate with some unsuspected environmental variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we have?\n",
    "* we usually have biased, opportunity sampling \n",
    "* we must account for bias (debiasing will be discussed later)\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we were designing sampling for representativity of the sample set and resulting sample statistics, by theory we have 2 options, random sampling and regular sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What would happen if you proposed random sampling in the Gulf of Mexico at $150M per well?\n",
    "\n",
    "We should not change current sampling methods as they result in best economics, we should address sampling bias in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Never use raw spatial data without access sampling bias / correcting.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mitigating Sampling Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demonstration we will take a biased spatial sample data set and apply declustering using **GeostatsPy** functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective \n",
    "\n",
    "In the PGE 383: Stochastic Subsurface Modeling class I want to provide hands-on experience with building subsurface modeling workflows. Python provides an excellent vehicle to accomplish this. I have coded a package called GeostatsPy with GSLIB: Geostatistical Library (Deutsch and Journel, 1998) functionality that provides basic building blocks for building subsurface modeling workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to remove the hurdles of subsurface modeling workflow construction by providing building blocks and sufficient examples. This is not a coding class per se, but we need the ability to 'script' workflows working with numerical methods.    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the steps to get setup in Python with the GeostatsPy package:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Anaconda 3 on your machine (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). \n",
    "2. From Anaconda Navigator (within Anaconda3 group), go to the environment tab, click on base (root) green arrow and open a terminal. \n",
    "3. In the terminal type: pip install geostatspy. \n",
    "4. Open Jupyter and in the top block get started by copy and pasting the code block below from this Jupyter Notebook to start using the geostatspy functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to copy the data file to your working directory.  They are available here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tabular data - sample_data_biased.csv at https://git.io/fh0CW\n",
    "\n",
    "There are exampled below with these functions. You can go here to see a list of the available functions, https://git.io/fh4eX, other example workflows and source code. "

I heard that plasma is known to be friendly to the color blind as the color and intensity vary together (hope I got that right, it was an interesting Twitter conversation started by Matt Hall from Agile if I recall correctly). We will assume a study area of 0 to 1,000m in x and y and omit any data outside this area."
