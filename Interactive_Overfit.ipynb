    "### PGE 383 Exercise: Interactive Predictive Model Complexity Tuning, Generalization & Overfit\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple workflow, demonstration of predictive machine learning model training and testing for overfit.  We use a:\n",
    "\n",
    "* simple polynomial model\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1 preditor feature and 1 response feature\n",
    "\n",
    "for an high interpretability model/ simple illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Train / Test Split\n",
    "\n",
    "The available data is split into training and testing subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* in general 15-30% of the data is withheld from training to apply as testing data\n",
    "\n",
    "* testing data selection should be fair, the same difficulty of predictions (offset/different from the training dat\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine Learning Model Traing\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data is applied to train the model parameters such that the model minimizes mismatch with the training data\n",
    "\n",
    "* it is common to use **mean square error** (known as a **L2 norm**) as a loss function summarizing the model mismatch\n",
    "\n",
    "* **miminizing the loss function** for simple models an anlytical solution may be available, but for most machine this requires an iterative optimization method to find the best model parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated over a range of model complexities specified by hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine Learning Model Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The withheld testing data is retrieved and loss function (usually the **L2 norm** again) is calculated to summarize the error over the testing data\n",
    "\n",
    "* this is repeated over over the range of specified hypparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* the model complexity / hyperparameters that minimize the loss function / error summary in testing is selected\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known are model hypparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine Learning Model Overfit\n",
    "\n",
    "More model complexity/flexibility than can be justified with the available data, data accuracy, frequency and coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model explains “idiosyncrasies” of the data, capturing data noise/error in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "* High accuracy in training, but low accuracy in testing / real-world use away from training data cases – poor ability of the model to generalize\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Workflow Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn the basics of machine learning training, tuning for model generalization while avoiding model overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demonstrate model training and tuning by hand with an interactive exercies\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demonstrate the role of data error in leading to model overfit with complicated models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to copy the following data files to your working directory.  They are available [here](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeoDataSets):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tabular data - [Stochastic_1D_por_perm_demo.csv](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeoDataSets/blob/master/Stochastic_1D_por_perm_demo.csv)\n",
    "* Tabular data - [Random_Parabola.csv](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeoDataSets/blob/master/Random_Parabola.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets are available in the folder: https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeoDataSets.\n",

    "#### Import Required Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also need some standard packages. These should have been installed with Anaconda 3."
