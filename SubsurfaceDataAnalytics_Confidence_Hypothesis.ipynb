    "\n",
    "With confidence intervals and hypothesis testing we have the opportunity to report uncertainty and to report significance in our statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "* report **uncertainty and significance** with our results\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tutorial / demonstration of **Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing in Python** for Subsurface Modeling.  In Python, the SciPy package, specifically the Stats functions (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) provide excellent tools for efficient use of statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial includes basic, typical confidence interval and hypothesis testing methods that would commonly be required for Engineers and Geoscientists including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Student-t confidence interval for the mean\n",
    "2. Student-t hypothesis test for difference in means (pooled variance)\n",
    "3. Student-t hypothesis test for difference in means (difference variances), Welch's t Test\n",
    "3. F-distribution hypothesis test for difference in variances \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Workflow Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Introduction to Python in Jupyter including setting a working directory, loading data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "1. Learn the basics for working with confidence intervals and hypothesis testing in Python.  \n",
    "2. Demonstrate the efficiency of using Python and SciPy package for statistical analysis.\n",
    "3. Learn how to quantify uncertainty and significance in samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective \n",
    "\n",
    "I want to provide hands-on experience with building subsurface modeling workflows. Python provides an excellent vehicle to accomplish this. I have coded a package called GeostatsPy with GSLIB: Geostatistical Library (Deutsch and Journel, 1998) functionality that provides basic building blocks for building subsurface modeling workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to remove the hurdles of subsurface modeling workflow construction by providing building blocks and sufficient examples. This is not a coding class per se, but we need the ability to 'script' workflows working with numerical methods.    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the steps to get setup in Python with the GeostatsPy package:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Anaconda 3 on your machine (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). \n",
    "2. From Anaconda Navigator (within Anaconda3 group), go to the environment tab, click on base (root) green arrow and open a terminal. \n",
    "3. In the terminal type: pip install geostatspy. \n",
    "4. Open Jupyter and in the top block get started by copy and pasting the code block below from this Jupyter Notebook to start using the geostatspy functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to copy the data file to your working directory.  They are available here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tabular data - PorositySample2Units.csv at https://git.io/fhrM8\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Load the required libraries\n",

The uncertainty in mean porosity at each well could be applied to calculate the uncertainty in the mean porosity applied to model porosity around the two wells. This method would account for the limited number of porosity samples available. If more porosity samples we available then this uncertainty would decrease (note the $\\sqrt{n}$ in the denominator of the confidence interval in the mean calculation above.\n",

    "One possible work flow would be to apply the affine correction from the *GeostatsPy* package to formulate a the P5 and P95 porosity distributions for porosity in each well. Note, these distribution scenarios are based only on uncertainty in the mean porosity and assumes the distribution tails are not anchored (are free to shift)."

    "Details about the test are available in the course notes (along with assumptions such as Gaussian distributed) and this example is also worked out by hand in the linked Excel workbook.  We can accomplish the F-test in with SciPy.Stats the function with one line of code if we calculate the ratio of the sample variances ensuring that the larger variance is in the numerator and get the degrees of freedom using the len() command, ensuring that we are consistent with the numerator degrees of freedom set as 'dfn' and the denominator degrees of freedom set as 'dfd'.  We take a p-value of $1-p$ since the test is configured to be a single, right tailed test.    "

    "The difference in the means and variances were tested for statistical significance for porosity measured in wells 1 and 2.  In all cases we rejected the null hypotheses and adopted the alternative hypotheses that the porosity distributions' means and variances for well 1 and 2 are statistically significant in their differences. It is possible that Well 1 and 2 have drilled into different rock units or have encountered nonstationary behavoirs in a single rock unit. This result may be applied to update subsurface maps and consider a difference in the subsurface at each well for development decision making."

    "We are just scratching the surface for the application of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to subsurface modeling.  Once again, there are a lot of details left out of the problem formulation and assumptions, see the course notes for more coverage.  By running the same confidence interval and hypothesis tests: 1) by hand in Excel and with 2) R and now here in 3) Python code, I hope this demonstration will enable and encourage more engineers and scientists to make these R and Python tools part of their common practice. I'm always happy to discuss,\n",
