    "Here's a interactive demonstration of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* trend fitting\n",
    "* spatial estimation with a trend model vs. a stationary mean\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trend Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Trend modeling is the modeling of local features, based on data and interpretation, that are deemed certain (known).  The trend is substracted from the data, leaving a residual that is modeled stochastically with uncertainty (treated as unknown).\n",
    "\n",
    "* geostatistical spatial estimation methods will make an assumption concerning stationarity\n",
    "    * in the presence of significant nonstationarity we can not rely on spatial estimates based on data + spatial continuity model\n",
    "* if we observe a trend, we should model the trend.\n",
    "    * then model the residuals stochastically\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. model trend consistent with data and intepretation at all locations within the area of itnerest, integrate all available information and expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "m(\\bf{u}_\\beta), \\, \\forall \\, \\beta \\in \\, AOI\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "2. substract trend from data at the $n$ data locations to formulate a residual at the data locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha}) = z(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha}) - m(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha}), \\, \\forall \\, \\alpha = 1, \\ldots, n\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "3. characterize the statistical behavoir of the residual $y(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha})$ integrating any information sources and interpretations.  For example the global cumulative distribution function and a measure of spatial continuity shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "F_y(y) \\quad \\gamma_y(\\bf{h})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "4. model the residual at all locations with $L$ multiple realizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Y^\\ell(\\bf{u}_\\beta),  \\, \\forall \\, \\beta \\, \\in \\, AOI; \\, \\ell = 1, \\ldots, L\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "5. add the trend back in to the stochastic residual realizations to calculate the multiple realizations, $L$, of the property of interest based on the composite model of known deterministic trend, $m(\\bf{u}_\\alpha)$ and unknown stochastic residual, $y(\\bf{u}_\\alpha)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Z^\\ell(\\bf{u}_\\beta) = Y^\\ell(\\bf{u}_\\beta) + m(\\bf{u}_\\beta),  \\, \\forall \\, \\beta \\in \\, AOI; \\, \\ell = 1, \\ldots, L\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "6. check the model, including quantification of the proportion of variance treated as known (trend) and unknown (residual).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma^2_{Z} = \\sigma^2_{Y} + \\sigma^2_{m} + 2 \\cdot C_{Y,m}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "given $C_{Y,m} \\to 0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma^2_{Z} = \\sigma^2_{Y} + \\sigma^2_{m}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "I can now describe the proportion of variance allocated to known and unknown components as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Prop_{Known} = \\frac{\\sigma^2_{m}}{\\sigma^2_{Y} + \\sigma^2_{m}} \\quad Prop_{Unknown} = \\frac{\\sigma^2_{Y}}{\\sigma^2_{Y} + \\sigma^2_{m}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "I provide some practical, data-driven methods for trend model, but I should indicate that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. trend modeling is very important in reservoir modeling as it has large impact on local model accuracy and on the undertainty model\n",
    "2. trend modeling is used in almost every subsurface model, unless the data is dense enough to impose local trends\n",
    "3. trend modeling includes a high degree of expert judgement combined with the integration of various information sources\n",
    "\n",
    "We limit ourselves to simple data-driven methods, but acknowledge much more is needed. In fact, trend modeling requires a high degree of knowledge concerning local geoscience and engineering data and knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now I add some additional details on spatial estimation, kriging and variograms to support use of this interactive demonstration. See my lectures on these topics at [My YouTube Channel](www.youtube.com/GeostatsGuyLectures).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case of making an estimate at some unsampled location, $𝑧(\\bf{u}_0)$, where $z$ is the property of interest (e.g. porosity etc.) and $𝐮_0$ is a location vector describing the unsampled location.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you do this given data, $𝑧(\\bf{𝐮}_1)$, $𝑧(\\bf{𝐮}_2)$, and $𝑧(\\bf{𝐮}_3)$?\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be natural to use a set of linear weights to formulate the estimator given the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "z^{*}(\\bf{u}) = \\sum^{n}_{\\alpha = 1} \\lambda_{\\alpha} z(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We could add an unbiasedness constraint to impose the sum of the weights equal to one.  What we will do is assign the remainder of the weight (one minus the sum of weights) to the global average; therefore, if we have no informative data we will estimate with the global average of the property of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "z^{*}(\\bf{u}) = \\sum^{n}_{\\alpha = 1} \\lambda_{\\alpha} z(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha}) + \\left(1-\\sum^{n}_{\\alpha = 1} \\lambda_{\\alpha} \\right) \\overline{z}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make a stationarity assumption, so let's assume that we are working with residuals, $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y^{*}(\\bf{u}) = z^{*}(\\bf{u}) - \\overline{z}(\\bf{u})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "If we substitute this form into our estimator the estimator simplifies, since the mean of the residual is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y^{*}(\\bf{u}) = \\sum^{n}_{\\alpha = 1} \\lambda_{\\alpha} y(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "while satisfying the unbaisedness constraint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kriging\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the next question is what weights should we use?  \n",
    "\n",
    "We could use equal weighting, $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n}$, and the estimator would be the average of the local data applied for the spatial estimate. This would not be very informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could assign weights considering the spatial context of the data and the estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **spatial continuity** as quantified by the variogram (and covariance function)\n",
    "* **redundancy** the degree of spatial continuity between all of the available data with themselves \n",
    "* **closeness** the degree of spatial continuity between the avaiable data and the estimation location\n",
    "\n",
    "The kriging approach accomplishes this, calculating the best linear unbiased weights for the local data to estimate at the unknown location.  The derivation of the kriging system and the resulting linear set of equations is available in the lecture notes.  Furthermore kriging provides a measure of the accuracy of the estimate!  This is the kriging estimation variance (sometimes just called the kriging variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma^{2}_{E}(\\bf{u}) = C(0) - \\sum^{n}_{\\alpha = 1} \\lambda_{\\alpha} C(\\bf{u}_0 - \\bf{u}_{\\alpha})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "What is 'best' about this estimate? Kriging estimates are best in that they minimize the above estimation variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties of Kriging\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some important properties of kriging:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exact interpolator** - kriging estimates with the data values at the data locations\n",
    "* **Kriging variance** can be calculated before getting the sample information, as the kriging estimation variance is not dependent on the values of the data nor the kriging estimate, i.e. the kriging estimator is homoscedastic. \n",
    "* **Spatial context** - kriging takes into account, furthermore to the statements on spatial continuity, closeness and redundancy we can state that kriging accounts for the configuration of the data and structural continuity of the variable being estimated.\n",
    "* **Scale** - kriging may be generalized to account for the support volume of the data and estimate. We will cover this later.\n",
    "* **Multivariate** - kriging may be generalized to account for multiple secondary data in the spatial estimate with the cokriging system. We will cover this later.\n",
    "* **Smoothing effect** of kriging can be forecast. We will use this to build stochastic simulations later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial Continuity \n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial Continuity** is the correlation between values over distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* No spatial continuity – no correlation between values over distance, random values at each location in space regardless of separation distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Homogenous phenomenon have perfect spatial continuity, since all values as the same (or very similar) they are correlated. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need a statistic to quantify spatial continuity! A convenient method is the Semivariogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Semivariogram\n",
    "\n",
    "Function of difference over distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The expected (average) squared difference between values separated by a lag distance vector (distance and direction), $h$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\gamma(\\bf{h}) = \\frac{1}{2 N(\\bf{h})} \\sum^{N(\\bf{h})}_{\\alpha=1} (z(\\bf{u}_\\alpha) - z(\\bf{u}_\\alpha + \\bf{h}))^2  \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z(\\bf{u}_\\alpha)$ and $z(\\bf{u}_\\alpha + \\bf{h})$ are the spatial sample values at tail and head locations of the lag vector respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculated over a suite of lag distances to obtain a continuous function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* the $\\frac{1}{2}$ term converts a variogram into a semivariogram, but in practice the term variogram is used instead of semivariogram.\n",
    "* We prefer the semivariogram because it relates directly to the covariance function, $C_x(\\bf{h})$ and univariate variance, $\\sigma^2_x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "C_x(\\bf{h}) = \\sigma^2_x - \\gamma(\\bf{h})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the correlogram is related to the covariance function as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\rho_x(\\bf{h}) = \\frac{C_x(\\bf{h})}{\\sigma^2_x}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlogram provides of function of the $\\bf{h}-\\bf{h}$ scatter plot correlation vs. lag offset $\\bf{h}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "-1.0 \\le \\rho_x(\\bf{h}) \\le 1.0\n",
    "\\end{equation}   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Started\n",
