    "### Exercise: Spatial Bootstrap for Subsurface Data Analytics in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple workflow, demonstration of spatial bootstrap for subsurface modeling workflows. This should help you get started with building subsurface models that integrate uncertainty in the sample statistics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty in the sample statistics\n",
    "* one source of uncertainty is the paucity of data.\n",
    "* do 200 or even less wells provide a precise (and accurate estimate) of the mean? standard deviation? skew? P13?\n",
    "\n",
    "Would it be useful to know the uncertainty in these statistics due to limited sampling?\n",
    "* what is the impact of uncertainty in the mean porosity e.g. 20%+/-2%?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bootstrap** is a method to assess the uncertainty in a sample statistic by repeated random sampling with replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions\n",
    "* sufficient, representative sampling, identical, idependent samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations\n",
    "1. assumes the samples are representative \n",
    "2. assumes stationarity\n",
    "3. only accounts for uncertainty due to too few samples, e.g. no uncertainty due to changes away from data\n",
    "4. does not account for boundary of area of interest \n",
    "5. assumes the samples are independent\n",
    "6. does not account for other local information sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Bootstrap Approach** (Efron, 1982)\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical resampling procedure to calculate uncertainty in a calculated statistic from the data itself.\n",
    "* Does this work?  Prove it to yourself, for uncertainty in the mean solution is standard error: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma^2_\\overline{x} = \\frac{\\sigma^2_s}{n}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Extremely powerful - could calculate uncertainty in any statistic!  e.g. P13, skew etc.\n",
    "* Would not be possible access general uncertainty in any statistic without bootstrap.\n",
    "* Advanced forms account for spatial information and sampling strategy (game theory and Journel’s spatial bootstrap (1993).\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. assemble a sample set, must be representative, reasonable to assume independence between samples\n",
    "\n",
    "2. optional: build a cumulative distribution function (CDF)\n",
    "    * may account for declustering weights, tail extrapolation\n",
    "    * could use analogous data to support\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For $\\ell = 1, \\ldots, L$ realizations, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For $i = \\alpha, \\ldots, n$ data, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Draw a random sample with replacement from the sample set or Monte Carlo simulate from the CDF (if available). \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Calculate a realization of the sammary statistic of interest from the $n$ samples, e.g. $m^\\ell$, $\\sigma^2_{\\ell}$. Return to 3 for another realization.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Compile and summarize the $L$ realizations of the statistic of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very powerful method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial Bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "Journel (1993) developed methods for spatial bootstrap based on bootstrap resampling accounting for the locations of the data and the spatial continuity model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* One method to perform spatial bootstrap for uncertainty of a statistic is to adjust the number of data, $n$, to the **number of effective data**, then use the number of effective data instead of number of data of resamples with replacement for each bootstrap realization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This number of effectve data may be calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* building multiple unconditional simulated realizations at the data locations only \n",
    "\n",
    "* calculating the variance of the average of each simulated realization\n",
    "\n",
    "* then calculate the number effective data by manipulating the standard error in the average equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma^2_\\overline{x} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "to be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "n^{'} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma^2_\\overline{x}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma^2_\\overline{x}$ is the variance of the average over bootstrap realizations $\\ell = 1,\\ldots,L$, $\\sigma^2$ is the variance / sill of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulating Only at the Data Locations\n",
    "\n",
    "We ultilize LU Simulation to efficiently calculate Gaussian realizations only at the data locations, based on the Lower-Upper Decomposition of the left-hand / redudancy martix of the simple kriging.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* We multiple the Lower matrix ($n \\times n$) with a random Gaussian vector ($1 \\times n$) to calculate each realization at the data locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We then take the average of each realization and then calculate the variance of the average over enough realizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective \n",
    "\n",
    "In the PGE 383: Stochastic Subsurface Modeling class I want to provide hands-on experience with building subsurface modeling workflows. Python provides an excellent vehicle to accomplish this. I have coded a package called GeostatsPy with GSLIB: Geostatistical Library (Deutsch and Journel, 1998) functionality that provides basic building blocks for building subsurface modeling workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to remove the hurdles of subsurface modeling workflow construction by providing building blocks and sufficient examples. This is not a coding class per se, but we need the ability to 'script' workflows working with numerical methods.    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the steps to get setup in Python with the GeostatsPy package:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Anaconda 3 on your machine (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). \n",
    "2. From Anaconda Navigator (within Anaconda3 group), go to the environment tab, click on base (root) green arrow and open a terminal. \n",
    "3. In the terminal type: pip install geostatspy. \n",
    "4. Open Jupyter and in the top block get started by copy and pasting the code block below from this Jupyter Notebook to start using the geostatspy functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to copy the data file to your working directory.  They are available here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tabular data - sample_data_biased.csv at https://git.io/fh0CW\n",
    "\n",
    "There are exampled below with these functions. You can go here to see a list of the available functions, https://git.io/fh4eX, other example workflows and source code. "
