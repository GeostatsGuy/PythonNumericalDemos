    "* the number of data (the maximum number of basis functions)\n",
    "* the kernel and kernel parameter (e.g. width of the Gaussian kernel)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Spatial Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case of making an estimate at some unsampled location, $ùëß(\\bf{u}_0)$, where $z$ is the property of interest (e.g. porosity etc.) and $ùêÆ_0$ is a location vector describing the unsampled location.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you do this given data, $ùëß(\\bf{ùêÆ}_1)$, $ùëß(\\bf{ùêÆ}_2)$, and $ùëß(\\bf{ùêÆ}_3)$?\n",

    "\n",
    "We could add an unbiasedness constraint to impose the sum of the weights equal to one.  What we will do is assign the remainder of the weight (one minus the sum of weights) to the global average; therefore, if we have no informative data we will estimate with the global average of the property of interest.\n",

    "1. Install Anaconda 3 on your machine (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). \n",
    "2. From Anaconda Navigator (within Anaconda3 group), go to the environment tab, click on base (root) green arrow and open a terminal. \n",
    "3. In the terminal type: pip install geostatspy. \n",
    "4. Open Jupyter and in the top block get started by copy and pasting the code block below from this Jupyter Notebook to start using the geostatspy functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to copy the data file to your working directory.  They are available here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tabular data - sample_data.csv at https://git.io/fh4gm.\n",

    "This was an interactive demonstration of radial basis function for spatial data analytics. Much more could be done, I have other demonstrations on the basics of working with DataFrames, ndarrays, univariate statistics, plotting data, declustering, data transformations and many other workflows available at https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/PythonNumericalDemos and https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPy. \n",
