    "This is a tutorial / demonstration of **Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing in Python**.  In Python, the SciPy package, specifically the Stats functions (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) provide excellent tools for efficient use of statistics.  \n",

In all cases, I use the same dataset available as a comma delimited file (https://git.io/fxLAt).    \n",

    "We are just scratching the surface for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.  Once again there are a lot of details left out of the problem formulation and assumptions, see the course notes for more coverage.  By running the same confidence interval and hypothesis tests 1) by hand in Excel and with 2) R and 3) Python code, I hope this demonstration will enable and encourage more engineers and scientists to make these R and Python tools part of their common practice. I'm always happy to discuss,\n",
