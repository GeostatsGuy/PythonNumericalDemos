<h3 align="center">Well documented Python workflows to help you over the intellectual hurdles of data science!</h3>

*To support my students in my **Data Analytics and Geostatistics**, **Spatial Data Analytics** and **Machine Learning** courses and anyone else learning data analytics and machine learning, I have developed a set of well-documented Python workflows. When students struggle with a concept I make and share a new well-documented so they can try out and repeat all the examples from my lectures to learn immediately how to apply the models or theoretical concepts!*

#### Setup

A minimum environment includes:

* Python 3.7.10 - due to the depdendency of GeostatsPy on the Numba package for code acceleration
* MatPlotLib - plotting
* NumPy - gridded data and array math
* Pandas - tabulated data
* SciPy - statistics module
* ipywidgets - for plot interactivity
* [GeostatsPy](https://pypi.org/project/geostatspy/) - geostatistical algorithms and functions (Pyrcz et al., 2021)

The required datasets are available in the [GeoDataSets](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeoDataSets) repository and linked in the workflows.

#### Repository Summary

I use these demonstrations for:

1. in-lecture walkthroughs 
2. hands-on experiential learning with specific tasks suggested in the accompanying lecture notes
3. example workflows to support my students

While I have more than 20 years experience coding in FORTRAN, C++ and VBA, I just started with Python a couple of years ago. I love it.  I code less and get more done!  I recommend Python to any engineers or scientists.  Here's some reasons to learn to code:

1. __Transparency__ – no compiler accepts hand waiving! Coding forces your logic to be uncovered for any other scientist or engineer to review.

2. __Reproducibility__ – run it, get an answer, hand it over, run it, get the same answer. This is a main principle of the scientific method.

3. __Quantification__ – programs need numbers. Feed the program and discover new ways to look at the world.

4. __Open-source__ – leverage a world of brilliance. Check out packages, snippets and be amazed with what great minds have freely shared.

5. __Break Down Barriers__ – don’t throw it over the fence. Sit at the table with the developers and share more of your subject matter expertise for a better product.

6. __Deployment__ – share it with others and multiply the impact. Performance metrics or altruism, your good work benefits many others.

7. __Efficiency__ – minimize the boring parts of the job. Build a suite of scripts for automation of common tasks and spend more time doing science and engineering!

8. __Always Time to Do it Again!__ – how many times did you only do it once? It probably takes 2-4 times as long to script and automate a workflow.  Usually worth it.

9. __Be Like Us__ – it will change you. Users feel limited, programmers truly harness the power of their applications and hardware. 

Alright, that is enough of my ranting. Especially, since I haven't even introduced myself yet!

#### Want to Work Together?

I hope this content is helpful to those that want to learn more about subsurface modeling, data analytics and machine learning. Students and working professionals are welcome to participate.

* Want to invite me to visit your company for training, mentoring, project review, workflow design and / or consulting? I'd be happy to drop by and work with you! 

* Interested in partnering, supporting my graduate student research or my Subsurface Data Analytics and Machine Learning consortium (co-PIs including Profs. Foster, Torres-Verdin and van Oort)? My research combines data analytics, stochastic modeling and machine learning theory with practice to develop novel methods and workflows to add value. We are solving challenging subsurface problems!
