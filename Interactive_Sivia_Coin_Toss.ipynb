    "\n",
    "I have a coin and you need to figure out if it is a fair coin!\n",
    "\n",
    "* a fair coin would have a 50% probability of heads (and a 50% probability of tails)\n",

    "\n",
    "* it could be based on how honest you think I am\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you perform a set of coin tosses to build a likelihood distribution, $P(Tosses | Coin)$\n",
    "\n",
    "* the more coin tosses, the narrower this distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you update the prior distribution with the likelihood distribution to get the posterior distribution, $P(Coin | Tosses)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P( Coin | Tosses ) = \\frac{P( Tosses | Coin ) P( Coin )}{P( Tosses )}\n",

    "\n",
    "1. interactive plotting in Jupyter Notebooks with Python packages matplotlib and ipywidgets\n",
    "2. provide an intuitive hands-on example of Bayesian updating   \n",

    "1. Install Anaconda 3 on your machine (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). \n",
