    "### Exercise: Tabular Data Structures / DataFrames in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tutorial for / demonstration of **Tabular Data Structures in Python**.  In Python, the common tool for dealing with Tabular Data Structures is the DataFrame from the pandas Python package. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Tabular Data in subsurface data analytics includes any data set with a limited number of samples as oposed to gridded maps that provide exhaustively sampled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial includes the methods and operations that would commonly be required for and Geoscientists, Engineers and Data Scientists working with Tabular Data Structures for the purpose of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Checking and Cleaning\n",
    "2. Data Mining / Inferential Data Analysis\n",
    "3. Data Analytics / Building Predictive Models with Geostatistics and Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to work with Pandas DataFrames is essential for dealing with tabular data (e.g. well data) in subsurface modeling workflows and for subsurface machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tabular Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python we will commonly store our data in two formats, tables and arrays.  For sampled data with typically multiple features $1,\\ldots,m$ over $1,\\ldots,n$ samples we will work with tables.  For exhaustive maps and models usually representing a single feature on a regular grid over $1,\\ldots,n_{i}$ for $i = 1,\\ldots,n_{dim}$ we will work with arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas package provides a convenient DataFrame object for working with data in a table and numpy package provides a convenient ndarray object for working with gridded data. In the following tutorial we will focus on DataFrames although we will utilize ndarrays a couple of times.  There is another section on Gridded Data Structures that focuses on ndarrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "These workflows are based on standard methods with their associated limitations and assumptions. For more information see:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [pandas DataFrames Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cggieFcKdiM&list=PLG19vXLQHvSDUmEOmBoaxGbFAbvaLdfx4&index=8&t=0s)\n",
    "\n",
    "I have provided various workflows for subsurface data analytics, geostatistics and machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Python](https://git.io/fh4eX)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Excel](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/LectureExercises/blob/master/Lecture7_CI_Hypoth_eg_R.xlsx) \n",

    "#### Workflow Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn the basics for working with Tabular Data Structures in Python. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loading tabular data\n",
    "* Visualizing tabular data\n",
    "* Data QC and Cleaning\n",
    "* Interacting with the tabular data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective \n",
    "\n",
    "I want to provide hands-on experience with building subsurface modeling workflows. Python provides an excellent vehicle to accomplish this. I have coded a package called GeostatsPy with GSLIB: Geostatistical Library (Deutsch and Journel, 1998) functionality that provides basic building blocks for building subsurface modeling workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to remove the hurdles of subsurface modeling workflow construction by providing building blocks and sufficient examples. This is not a coding class per se, but we need the ability to 'script' workflows working with numerical methods.    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the steps to get setup in Python with the GeostatsPy package:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Anaconda 3 on your machine (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). \n",
    "2. From Anaconda Navigator (within Anaconda3 group), go to the environment tab, click on base (root) green arrow and open a terminal. \n",
    "3. In the terminal type: pip install geostatspy. \n",
    "4. Open Jupyter and in the top block get started by copy and pasting the code block below from this Jupyter Notebook to start using the geostatspy functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to copy the data file to your working directory.  They are available here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tabular data - 2D_MV_200wells.csv at [here].(https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeoDataSets/blob/master/2D_MV_200wells.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "I have put together various subsurface workflows for data analytics, geostatistics and machine learning. Go [here](https://git.io/fh4eX) for other example workflows and source code. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Load the required libraries\n",
