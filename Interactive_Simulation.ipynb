    "### The Interactive Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple workflow for calculating the sequential Gaussian simulation with sequential use of simple kriging estimate and the estimation variance for a local uncertainty model and Monte Carlo simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* we use a 'toy problem' with only 3 data for speed and interpretability of the results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case of making an estimate at some unsampled location, $𝑧(\\bf{u}_0)$, where $z$ is the property of interest (e.g. porosity etc.) and $𝐮_0$ is a location vector describing the unsampled location.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you do this given data, $𝑧(\\bf{𝐮}_1)$, $𝑧(\\bf{𝐮}_2)$, and $𝑧(\\bf{𝐮}_3)$?\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be natural to use a set of linear weights to formulate the estimator given the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "z^{*}(\\bf{u}) = \\sum^{n}_{\\alpha = 1} \\lambda_{\\alpha} z(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We could add an unbiasedness constraint to impose the sum of the weights equal to one.  What we will do is assign the remainder of the weight (one minus the sum of weights) to the global average; therefore, if we have no informative data we will estimate with the global average of the property of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "z^{*}(\\bf{u}) = \\sum^{n}_{\\alpha = 1} \\lambda_{\\alpha} z(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha}) + \\left(1-\\sum^{n}_{\\alpha = 1} \\lambda_{\\alpha} \\right) \\overline{z}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make a stationarity assumption, so let's assume that we are working with residuals, $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y^{*}(\\bf{u}) = z^{*}(\\bf{u}) - \\overline{z}(\\bf{u})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "If we substitute this form into our estimator the estimator simplifies, since the mean of the residual is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y^{*}(\\bf{u}) = \\sum^{n}_{\\alpha = 1} \\lambda_{\\alpha} y(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "while satisfying the unbaisedness constraint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kriging\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the next question is what weights should we use?  \n",
    "\n",
    "We could use equal weighting, $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n}$, and the estimator would be the average of the local data applied for the spatial estimate. This would not be very informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could assign weights considering the spatial context of the data and the estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **spatial continuity** as quantified by the variogram (and covariance function)\n",
    "* **redundancy** the degree of spatial continuity between all of the available data with themselves \n",
    "* **closeness** the degree of spatial continuity between the avaiable data and the estimation location\n",
    "\n",
    "The kriging approach accomplishes this, calculating the best linear unbiased weights for the local data to estimate at the unknown location.  The derivation of the kriging system and the resulting linear set of equations is available in the lecture notes.  Furthermore kriging provides a measure of the accuracy of the estimate!  This is the kriging estimation variance (sometimes just called the kriging variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma^{2}_{E}(\\bf{u}) = C(0) - \\sum^{n}_{\\alpha = 1} \\lambda_{\\alpha} C(\\bf{u}_0 - \\bf{u}_{\\alpha})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "What is 'best' about this estimate? Kriging estimates are best in that they minimize the above estimation variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties of Kriging\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some important properties of kriging:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exact interpolator** - kriging estimates with the data values at the data locations\n",
    "* **Kriging variance** can be calculated before getting the sample information, as the kriging estimation variance is not dependent on the values of the data nor the kriging estimate, i.e. the kriging estimator is homoscedastic. \n",
    "* **Spatial context** - kriging takes into account, furthermore to the statements on spatial continuity, closeness and redundancy we can state that kriging accounts for the configuration of the data and structural continuity of the variable being estimated.\n",
    "* **Scale** - kriging may be generalized to account for the support volume of the data and estimate. We will cover this later.\n",
    "* **Multivariate** - kriging may be generalized to account for multiple secondary data in the spatial estimate with the cokriging system. We will cover this later.\n",
    "* **Smoothing effect** of kriging can be forecast. We will use this to build stochastic simulations later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial Continuity \n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial Continuity** is the correlation between values over distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* No spatial continuity – no correlation between values over distance, random values at each location in space regardless of separation distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Homogenous phenomenon have perfect spatial continuity, since all values as the same (or very similar) they are correlated. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need a statistic to quantify spatial continuity! A convenient method is the Semivariogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Semivariogram\n",
    "\n",
    "Function of difference over distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The expected (average) squared difference between values separated by a lag distance vector (distance and direction), $h$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\gamma(\\bf{h}) = \\frac{1}{2 N(\\bf{h})} \\sum^{N(\\bf{h})}_{\\alpha=1} (z(\\bf{u}_\\alpha) - z(\\bf{u}_\\alpha + \\bf{h}))^2  \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z(\\bf{u}_\\alpha)$ and $z(\\bf{u}_\\alpha + \\bf{h})$ are the spatial sample values at tail and head locations of the lag vector respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculated over a suite of lag distances to obtain a continuous function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* the $\\frac{1}{2}$ term converts a variogram into a semivariogram, but in practice the term variogram is used instead of semivariogram.\n",
    "* We prefer the semivariogram because it relates directly to the covariance function, $C_x(\\bf{h})$ and univariate variance, $\\sigma^2_x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "C_x(\\bf{h}) = \\sigma^2_x - \\gamma(\\bf{h})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the correlogram is related to the covariance function as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\rho_x(\\bf{h}) = \\frac{C_x(\\bf{h})}{\\sigma^2_x}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlogram provides of function of the $\\bf{h}-\\bf{h}$ scatter plot correlation vs. lag offset $\\bf{h}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "-1.0 \\le \\rho_x(\\bf{h}) \\le 1.0\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequential Gaussian Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "With sequential Gaussian simulation we build on kriging by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* adding a random residual with the missing variance\n",
    "\n",
    "* sequentially adding the simulated values as data to correct the covariance between the simulated values\n",
    "\n",
    "I have more on this topic at [Simulation YouTube Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cLqK3lR56Y&list=PLG19vXLQHvSB-D4XKYieEku9GQMQyAzjJ&index=45&t=813s).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective \n",
    "\n",
    "In the PGE 383: Stochastic Subsurface Modeling class I want to provide hands-on experience with building subsurface modeling workflows. Python provides an excellent vehicle to accomplish this. I have coded a package called GeostatsPy with GSLIB: Geostatistical Library (Deutsch and Journel, 1998) functionality that provides basic building blocks for building subsurface modeling workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to remove the hurdles of subsurface modeling workflow construction by providing building blocks and sufficient examples. This is not a coding class per se, but we need the ability to 'script' workflows working with numerical methods.    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the steps to get setup in Python with the GeostatsPy package:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Anaconda 3 on your machine (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). \n",
    "2. From Anaconda Navigator (within Anaconda3 group), go to the environment tab, click on base (root) green arrow and open a terminal. \n",
    "3. In the terminal type: pip install geostatspy. \n",
    "4. Open Jupyter and in the top block get started by copy and pasting the code block below from this Jupyter Notebook to start using the geostatspy functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to copy the data file to your working directory.  They are available here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tabular data - sample_data.csv at https://git.io/fh4gm.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are exampled below with these functions. You can go here to see a list of the available functions, https://git.io/fh4eX, other example workflows and source code. \n",
    "\n",
