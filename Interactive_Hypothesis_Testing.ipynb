    "\n",
    "1. extracted sample set 1 and 2, the means look different, but are they? \n",
    "2. should we suspect that the samples are in fact from 2 different populations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's try the t-test, hypothesis test for difference in means.  This test assumes that the variances are similar along with the data being Gaussian distributed (see the course notes for more on this).  This is our test:\n",

    "#### The Welch's t-test for Difference in Means by Analytical and Empirical Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We work with the following test statistic, *t statistic*, from the two sample sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{t} = \\frac{\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \\frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\overline{x}_1$ and $\\overline{x}_2$ are the sample means, $s^2_1$ and $s^2_2$ are the sample variances and $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the numer of samples from the two datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical value, $t_{critical}$ is calculated by the analytical expression by:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the sampling distribution of the t_{statistic} and t_{critical} may be calculated empirically with bootstrap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow proceeds as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* shift both sample sets to have the mean of the combined data, $x_1$ → $x^*_1$, $x_2$ → $x^*_2$ \n",
    "\n",
    "* for each bootstrap realization, $\\ell=1\\ldots,L$\n",
    "\n",
    "    * perform $n_1$ Monte Carlo simulations, draws with replacement, from sample set $x^*_1$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * perform $n_2$ Monte Carlo simulations, draws with replacement, from sample set $x^*_2$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * calculate the t_{statistic} realization, $\\hat{t}^{\\ell}$ given the resulting sample means $\\overline{x}^{*,\\ell}_1$ and $\\overline{x}^{*,\\ell}_2$ and the sample variances $s^{*,2,\\ell}_1$ and $s^{*,2,\\ell}_2$\n",

    "\n",

    "#### Bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty in the sample statistics\n",
    "* one source of uncertainty is the paucity of data.\n",
    "* do 200 or even less wells provide a precise (and accurate estimate) of the mean? standard deviation? skew? P13?\n",
    "\n",
    "Would it be useful to know the uncertainty in these statistics due to limited sampling?\n",
    "* what is the impact of uncertainty in the mean porosity e.g. 20%+/-2%?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bootstrap** is a method to assess the uncertainty in a sample statistic by repeated random sampling with replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions\n",
    "* sufficient, representative sampling, identical, idependent samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations\n",
    "1. assumes the samples are representative \n",
    "2. assumes stationarity\n",
    "3. only accounts for uncertainty due to too few samples, e.g. no uncertainty due to changes away from data\n",
    "4. does not account for boundary of area of interest \n",
    "5. assumes the samples are independent\n",
    "6. does not account for other local information sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bootstrap Approach (Efron, 1982)\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical resampling procedure to calculate uncertainty in a calculated statistic from the data itself.\n",
    "* Does this work?  Prove it to yourself, for uncertainty in the mean solution is standard error: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma^2_\\overline{x} = \\frac{\\sigma^2_s}{n}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Extremely powerful - could calculate uncertainty in any statistic!  e.g. P13, skew etc.\n",
    "* Would not be possible access general uncertainty in any statistic without bootstrap.\n",
    "* Advanced forms account for spatial information and sampling strategy (game theory and Journel’s spatial bootstrap (1993).\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. assemble a sample set, must be representative, reasonable to assume independence between samples\n",
    "\n",
    "2. optional: build a cumulative distribution function (CDF)\n",
    "    * may account for declustering weights, tail extrapolation\n",
    "    * could use analogous data to support\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For $\\ell = 1, \\ldots, L$ realizations, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For $i = \\alpha, \\ldots, n$ data, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Draw a random sample with replacement from the sample set or Monte Carlo simulate from the CDF (if available). \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Calculate a realization of the sammary statistic of interest from the $n$ samples, e.g. $m^\\ell$, $\\sigma^2_{\\ell}$. Return to 3 for another realization.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Compile and summarize the $L$ realizations of the statistic of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very powerful method.  Let's try it out and compare the result to the analytical form of the confidence interval for the sample mean. \n",

    "Provide an example and demonstration for:\n",

    "1. interactive plotting in Jupyter Notebooks with Python packages matplotlib and ipywidgets\n",

    "#### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Some observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* lower dispersion and higher difference in means increases the absolute magnitude of the observed $t_{statistic}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* the bootstrap distribution closely matches the analytical distribution if $L$ is large enough\n",
    "\n",
    "* it is possible to use bootstrap to calculate the sampling distribution instead of relying on the theoretical express distribution, in this case the Student's t distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a demonstration of interactive hypothesis testing for the significance in difference in means aboserved between 2 sample sets in Jupyter Notebook Python with the ipywidgets and matplotlib packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have many other demonstrations on data analytics and machine learning, e.g. on the basics of working with DataFrames, ndarrays, univariate statistics, plotting data, declustering, data transformations, trend modeling and many other workflows available at https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/PythonNumericalDemos and https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPy. \n",
