    "#### Objective \n",
    "\n",
    "In the PGE 383: Stochastic Subsurface Modeling class I want to provide hands-on experience with building subsurface modeling workflows. Python provides an excellent vehicle to accomplish this. I have coded a package called GeostatsPy with GSLIB: Geostatistical Library (Deutsch and Journel, 1998) functionality that provides basic building blocks for building subsurface modeling workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to remove the hurdles of subsurface modeling workflow construction by providing building blocks and sufficient examples. This is not a coding class per se, but we need the ability to 'script' workflows working with numerical methods.    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the steps to get setup in Python with the GeostatsPy package:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Anaconda 3 on your machine (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). \n",
    "2. From Anaconda Navigator (within Anaconda3 group), go to the environment tab, click on base (root) green arrow and open a terminal. \n",
    "3. In the terminal type: pip install geostatspy. \n",
    "4. Open Jupyter and in the top block get started by copy and pasting the code block below from this Jupyter Notebook to start using the geostatspy functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to copy the data file to your working directory.  They are available here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tabular data - sample_data.csv at https://git.io/fh4gm.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are exampled below with these functions. You can go here to see a list of the available functions, https://git.io/fh4eX, other example workflows and source code. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Load the required libraries\n",
